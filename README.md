# repo-info

An example single page application, using the Github API. Less than feature complete, but easily extendable/modifiable.

This application uses the following libraries:

* [Routie](https://github.com/jgallen23/routie) - A simple Javascript hash router.
* [doT](https://github.com/olado/doT) - A small but advanced template system. Used for generating the views.

This application uses the following url formats:

* `#repo/OWNER/REPO/home` [~](http://ir-g.uk/repo-info/#repo/isaacrg/repo-info/home)
* `#repo/OWNER/REPO/commits` [~](http://ir-g.uk/repo-info/#repo/isaacrg/repo-info/commits)
